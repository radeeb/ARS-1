        <h3> GOLF</h3>
        <section id="golf">
            <h3 id="header">Tiger Woods is back</h3>
            <p id="article">>I don't mean that in the sense that it's hard to watch him, at 42 years old, try to
                recapture
                the glories of his astonishing,
                but now distant, prime. Quite the contrary. Yes, watching and writing about Tiger at his peak was a
                thrill.
                But I've grown to
                believe watching Tiger wrestle with time, seeing him relearning the rhythms of his body as he attempts
                to
                summon one last run at
                Jack Nicklaus' majors record, has a chance to be the most enjoyable era of his career. You might
                disagree --
                because who in their
                right mind wouldn't prefer to have the 2000 Tiger or 2006 Tiger back? -- but consider this: Tiger was
                never
                meant to play the
                underdog. He has always been golf's Goliath, a dominant force who didn't beat other players; he
                steamrolled
                them. It was
                awe-inspiring, but, at the height of his powers, it sometimes felt like rooting for a corporation. Yet,
                here
                we are, the week of
                the 2018 Masters, with a healthy Tiger having a realistic chance to chase an unexpected, improbable
                finish.
                When I say it's hard
                to watch him play, I mean it literally. You have to push and elbow your way through a gallery that feels
                more like a crowded street
                bazaar. You have to crane your neck and invade someone's personal space just to get a glimpse of him on
                the
                tee as he mulls whether
                to hit driver or 3-wood. Often, right when you finally get a sliver of daylight and an unobstructed
                view, a
                person near you will
                thrust their cellphone into your line of sight, camera rolling, because he or she is desperate to take
                home
                a pixelated souvenir.
                This phenomenon isn't limited to a particular demographic. People of all ages, races, tax brackets, and
                parts of the country are
                back by his side, and most of them cannot resist shouting encouragement to a man who almost never
                acknowledges it. Spend a day
                following Tiger around and you can't help but notice that one word pops up over and over again. Frat
                boys,
                socialites, finance bros,
                lawyers, hippies, soccer moms, biker dudes and little kids all shout out some version of it as he
                strolls
                by, in a way that feels
                like a mixture of reassurance and longing.

        <h3> CRICKET</h3>
        <section id="cricket">
            <h3 id="header">We cannot continue to neglect Bangladesh women's cricket</h3>
            <p id="article">USD 66,600 or approximately Tk 56 lakh—that is the difference between the yearly salary of the highest graded women cricketers of India and Bangladesh. Indian cricketers receive a daily payment, for their participation in domestic cricket, of Rs 12,500. Bangladesh's cricketers, on the other hand, get paid Tk 600 as match allowance in domestic leagues. That is basically what cricketers who aren't in the national contract play for.
                No. This isn't a call for the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to match its vastly experienced neighbours. However, recognising the stark difference in payment is necessary to realise the sheer importance of Bangladesh's Asia Cup win.

            <h3 id="header">Brazil to train coaches, school students to improve Bangladesh football</h3>
            <p id="article">State Minister for Sports Biren Sikder revealed the development after a meeting with Brazillian Ambassador in Dhaka Joao Tabajara de Oliveira Junior at the Secretariat on Thursday.

Biren said Brazil provide training at school-level football under a social programme in China.

“Similarly, they want to work with the government to take Bangladesh’s football forward. We’ve invited them to visit BKSP (national sport institution),” he said.

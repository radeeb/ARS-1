            <h3 id="header">Tiger Woods is back</h3>
            <p id="article">>I don't mean that in the sense that it's hard to watch him, at 42 years old, try to
                recapture
                the glories of his astonishing,
                but now distant, prime. Quite the contrary. Yes, watching and writing about Tiger at his peak was a
                thrill.
                But I've grown to
                believe watching Tiger wrestle with time, seeing him relearning the rhythms of his body as he attempts
                to
                summon one last run at
                Jack Nicklaus' majors record, has a chance to be the most enjoyable era of his career. You might
                disagree --
                because who in their
                right mind wouldn't prefer to have the 2000 Tiger or 2006 Tiger back? -- but consider this: Tiger was
                never
                meant to play the
                underdog. He has always been golf's Goliath, a dominant force who didn't beat other players; he
                steamrolled
                them. It was
                awe-inspiring, but, at the height of his powers, it sometimes felt like rooting for a corporation. Yet,
                here
                we are, the week of
                the 2018 Masters, with a healthy Tiger having a realistic chance to chase an unexpected, improbable
                finish.
                When I say it's hard
                to watch him play, I mean it literally. You have to push and elbow your way through a gallery that feels
                more like a crowded street
                bazaar. You have to crane your neck and invade someone's personal space just to get a glimpse of him on
                the
                tee as he mulls whether
                to hit driver or 3-wood. Often, right when you finally get a sliver of daylight and an unobstructed
                view, a
                person near you will
                thrust their cellphone into your line of sight, camera rolling, because he or she is desperate to take
                home
                a pixelated souvenir.
                This phenomenon isn't limited to a particular demographic. People of all ages, races, tax brackets, and
                parts of the country are
                back by his side, and most of them cannot resist shouting encouragement to a man who almost never
                acknowledges it. Spend a day
                following Tiger around and you can't help but notice that one word pops up over and over again. Frat
                boys,
                socialites, finance bros,
                lawyers, hippies, soccer moms, biker dudes and little kids all shout out some version of it as he
                strolls
                by, in a way that feels
                like a mixture of reassurance and longing.

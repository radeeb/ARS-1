            <h3 id="header">World largest dinosaur found in Scotland</h3>
            <p id="article">Rare dinosaur footprints belonging to the largest animal to ever roam the planet have been
                found
                in Scotland.
                Dozens of the 170 million-year-old fossils, belonging to early sauropods, have been unearthed in a muddy
                lagoon on the isle of Skye.
                Sauropods grew to be at least 49ft (15 metres) long and weighed more than 10 tonnes. Footprints from
                theropods - the "older cousins"
                of Tyrannosaurus rex who stood at two meters tall - were also found. They are thought to be the oldest
                dinosaur fossils ever found
                in Scotland. Another set of footprints were also found on Skye in 2015, but are slightly younger and
                slightly smaller.
                Geologists say the new finds are important as evidence from the Middle Jurassic period is rare, and few
                such
                fossil sites
                have been found around the world. The discovery adds to growing evidence the prehistoric reptiles were
                widespread on Skye at a
                pivotal time in their evolution. It also shows many dinosaurs, far from being restricted to the land,
                often
                lived near water and
                would wade through ancient lagoons to find food. Dr Steve Brusatte of Edinburgh University said: "It's
                important because it's a
                large site for dinosaur tracks, those are pretty hard to find. It shows both long-necked and meat-eaters
                were on the same site at
                the same time living together, side-by-side. It captures a moment in time 170 million years ago when
                they
                were just hanging out in a
                lagoon, living on the beach, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march
                to
                global dominance. Their
                long-necked prints are almost car tyre size whereas the meat-eater ones are about the size of a basket
                ball." Dr Brusatte added:
                â€œThe more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur footprints we find.

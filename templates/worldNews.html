            <h3 id="header">World largest dinosaur found in Scotland </h3>
            <p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/326/426/506.jpg" height="200" width="200"></p>
            <p id="article">Rare dinosaur footprints belonging to the largest animal to ever roam the planet have been
                found in Scotland. Dozens of the 170 million-year-old fossils, belonging to early sauropods, have been
                unearthed in a muddy lagoon on the isle of Skye. Sauropods grew to be at least 49ft (15 metres) long and
                weighed more than 10 tonnes. Footprints from theropods - the "older cousins" of Tyrannosaurus rex who
                stood at two meters tall - were also found. They are thought to be the oldest dinosaur fossils ever
                found in Scotland. Another set of footprints were also found on Skye in 2015, but are slightly younger
                and slightly smaller. Geologists say the new finds are important as evidence from the Middle Jurassic
                period is rare, and few such fossil sites have been found around the world. The discovery adds to
                growing evidence the prehistoric reptiles were widespread on Skye at a pivotal time in their evolution.
                It also shows many dinosaurs, far from being restricted to the land, often lived near water and would
                wade through ancient lagoons to find food. Dr Steve Brusatte of Edinburgh University said: "It's
                important because it's a large site for dinosaur tracks, those are pretty hard to find. It shows both
                long-necked and meat-eaters were on the same site at the same time living together, side-by-side. It
                captures a moment in time 170 million years ago when they were just hanging out in a lagoon, living on
                the beach, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march to global
                dominance. Their long-necked prints are almost car tyre size whereas the meat-eater ones are about the
                size of a basket ball." Dr Brusatte added: â€œThe more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur
                footprints we find.

            <h3 id="header">Turkey lifts state of emergency, two years after coup almost toppled Erdogan</h3>
            <p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/326/426/506.jpg" height="200" width="200"></p>
            <p id="article">
                Turkey lifted a state of emergency Thursday, two years after a dramatic coup attempt nearly toppled
                President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

                The news was announced by the state-run Anadolu news agency.
                "To enact a state of emergency, the government must foresee serious indications of widespread violence
                which may interfere with the democratic environment or basic constitutional rights and freedoms of its
                citizens," it said in a report.
                A state of emergency was declared on July 20, 2016, after the deadly coup attempt left at least 290
                people dead and more than 1,400 injured in a chaotic night of violence.
                &#39;I can&#39;t forget that night&#39;: Fear and optimism in Turkey one year after failed coup
                'I can't forget that night': Fear and optimism in Turkey one year after failed coup
                Tanks rolled into the streets of Turkey's two largest cities as soldiers blocked the famous Bosphorus
                Bridge in Istanbul, bombs struck the parliament building in the capital Ankara, and a helicopter stolen
                by rogue pilots was shot down by an F-16 jet.
                President Erdogan was hundreds of miles away at a seaside resort when the coup, mounted by a faction of
                the military, got underway. By the time Erdogan emerged to address the nation via FaceTime hours later,
                it had already begun to fizzle.
                Thousands of alleged plotters were rounded up the following day, as Erdogan claimed his exiled former
                ally Fethullah Gulen was behind the attempt, a charge the US-based cleric denied.
